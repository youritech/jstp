## Agenda

1. Contribution guidelines.
2. Relationship with <https://github.com/jstp>.
3. Compliance with JSON5 specs. The future of our custom data formats.
4. The front page of the project.

## Decisions

### 1. Contribution guidelines

The number of active contributors has doubled over the last time, so the
existing policy that allowed landing PRs as soon as they are approved does not
work anymore. We have already encountered a situation when a PR has landed
prematurely without a proper review from a collaborator other than one who had
reviewed it and, consequently, without addressing their feedback. Because of
that we need a minimal waiting time, which we have agreed upon to be 24 hours,
skipping weekends and holidays.

That, and all the conventions that we have had, must be documented.

### 2. Relationship with <https://github.com/jstp>.

Using the name "JSTP" when another similar project with the same name has
already existed (even though it has been inactive for a long time) is
inappropriate, may lead to confusion and is a potential infringement. We must
get in touch with the people behind it and either get approval to use the name
or rename our project.

### 3. Compliance with JSON5 specs. The future of our custom data formats.

What has been called "Record Serialization" should be plain JSON5. Given the
fact that we have implemented some minor features not present in JSON5 specs
(like ES2015 syntax for octal and binary literals), it is okay if we keep them,
but the parser must be able to parse any valid JSON5 and the serializer must
emit strict JSON5. In the future we might also consider decoupling the serdes
facilities built into the JSTP into a separate npm package (like "fast-json5" or
"metarhia-json5").

What has been called "Object Serialization" should be removed from the codebase.
There's no sensible use case for it and there's no way to implement it in secure
and performant fashion.

### 4. The front page of the project.

The `README.md` file should be updated to reflect the current vision of the
project. It is misleading in some points and makes people who try to get
acquainted with the project confused. Besides that, a new section with the list
of the project's maintainers should be added.
