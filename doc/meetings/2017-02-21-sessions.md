### Agenda

 * General way of reconnection to existing sessions;
 * Session restoration mechanisms architecture;
 * The problems with reconnection mobile developers encountered in our last
   project and proper ways to solve them;
 * Handshake packet formats (for request and response) that will be used to
   implement reconnection to existing sessions.

### Conclusions

 * To make packet numbers unique for every session, not connection like it was
   before;
 * To send total count of packets sent and received by each side during the
   session in handshake packet, like this:

   ```javascript
   { handshake: [0, 'appName'], session: ['sessionId', sent_count, received_count] }
   ```

   and answer

   ```javascript
   { handshake: [0], ok: [sent_count, received_count] }
   ```

### Post-discussion additions

1. Even though packet IDs are incremented throughout the session, not the
   connection, handshake packets are always 0 since we don't know which packet
   IDs to use until a handshake has been performed. After that, the order
   continues as it should have been if there hadn't been reconnection, with an
   extra handshake being transparent.

2. The standard `ERR_AUTH_FAILED` error will be used for any handshake
   authentication strategy, regardless of it being `login`, `session` or
   anything we may probably add later. What it means for session restoration
   handshakes is that if session ID is invalid, the server responds with

   ```javascript
   { handshake: [0], error: [11] }
   ```

UPD: Packet term was renamed to message hence every place packet is mentioned
message should be assumed instead.
